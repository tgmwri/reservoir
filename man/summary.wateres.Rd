\usage{
\method{summary}{wateres}(object, ..., reliability = 1,
  empirical_rel = FALSE, upper_limit = 5)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A wateres object.}

\item{...}{Further arguments are not used.}

\item{reliability}{A reliability value passed to the \code{\link{sry.wateres}} function.}

\item{empirical_rel}{Whether empirical probability will be used for reliability, passed to the \code{\link{sry.wateres}} function.}

\item{upper_limit}{An upper limit of yield (as multiple of the mean annual flow) for optimization passed to the \code{\link{sry.wateres}} function.}
}
\value{
A vector of reservoir characteristics:
  \item{Vpot}{potential reservoir storage in m3 (given as a parameter of \code{\link{as.wateres}})}
  \item{Qn_max}{the maximum yield (m3.s-1) for 100\% reliability for given potential storage}
  \item{alpha}{level of development - ratio Qn_max to the mean annual flow}
  \item{m}{standardized net inflow - a measure of resilience calculated as (1 - alpha) / (standard deviation of annual flows / mean annual flow)}
  \item{resilience}{resilience calculated as number of continuous sequences of failures / total number of time steps with failures, NA for no failure}
  \item{vulnerability}{vulnerability (in m3) calculated as mean of monthly deficit volumes that represent maximum deficit of each failure period}
  \item{dimless_vulner}{dimensionless vulnerability, vulnerability value divided by yield value in volume units}
}
\description{
Calculates and shows characteristics of the reservoir.
}
\details{
The maximum yield is calculated by using the \code{\link{sry.wateres}} function for potential storage and reliability 1.

  An error occurs if the range given by \code{upper_limit} does not contain value of 100\% reliability or if an invalid reliability is given.
