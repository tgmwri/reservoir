\usage{
\method{summary}{wateres}(object, ..., reliability = "max")
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A \code{wateres} object.}

\item{...}{Further arguments passed to the \code{\link{sry.wateres}} function (as \code{storage}, \code{yield}, \code{prob_type} or \code{upper_limit}).}

\item{reliability}{A vector of reliability values passed to the \code{\link{sry.wateres}} function.}
}
\value{
A data table of reservoir characteristics:
  \item{storage}{reservoir storage in m3, given or the minimum storage calculated for given reliability and yield}
  \item{reliability}{given or calculated reliability}
  \item{yield}{the maximum yield (m3.s-1), given or calculated for given reliability and potential storage}
  \item{alpha}{level of development - ratio of yield to the mean annual flow}
  \item{m}{standardized net inflow - a measure of resilience calculated as (1 - alpha) / (standard deviation of annual flows / mean annual flow)}
  \item{resilience}{resilience calculated as number of continuous sequences of failures / total number of time steps with failures, NA for no failure}
  \item{vulnerability}{vulnerability (in m3) calculated as mean of monthly deficit volumes that represent maximum deficit of each failure period}
  \item{dimless_vulner}{dimensionless vulnerability, vulnerability value divided by yield value in volume units}
}
\description{
Calculates characteristics of the reservoir.
}
\details{
The maximum yield or the minimum storage is calculated by using the \code{\link{sry.wateres}} function for given storage or yield and reliability.

  To calculate reliability for given storage and yield without any optimization, provide all the three arguments: storage, reliability (will be ignored)
  and yield.

  An error occurs if the range given by \code{upper_limit} does not contain value of the given reliability or if an invalid reliability value or probability
  type is given.
